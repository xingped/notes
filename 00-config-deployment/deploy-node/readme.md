# Heroku Deployment with Node + Sequelize 

## Objectives
* Understand the purpose of Heroku as a Platform as a Service (PaaS)
* Identify other methods of deployment, and their benefits and drawbacks
* Take a working Node/Sequelize app and deploy it to a server
* Make changes to an existing deployment
* Utilize methods for debugging server errors

## Introduction

When we have finished developing a version of our app, we likely want to put it on the internet for other people to see.

You can use our Taco CRUD app for deployment. https://github.com/WDI-SEA/tacoapp

### Localhost

Most of what we've developed so far has just run on our own computers. Both our database and our web server have been on our computer. We've done this because it's much easier to develop locally because we don't actually need an internet connection. However, people can't access it easily unless they are also on our local network.

Options?

####Buy Another Computer

We could just buy another computer somewhere else and use it to run our applications - or even more than one, if needed, and by the way, a server is a computer. We could connect this other computer to the internet and with a bit of configuration, we could allow people to connect to it using a URL.

However, we'd have to buy and look after this computer, have somewhere to store it and ensure that it was working and always connected to the internet. Also, if someone hit an error when they used our app, we might have to stop and start it? Maybe there is a better way?

####Use a Cloud Computing Platform

We could also use Amazon Web Services or similar cloud services, which provide the servers needed to host applications via the cloud. While many companies use AWS for deployment (such as Netflix), we are expected to not only deploy our system, but also set up the system architecture for our application. This includes logging in to the remote server, setting up the web server, and managing configuration and databases. While this provides a lot of flexibility for larger applications, there's a large learning curve that leans towards Linux system administration. Luckily, there is an even better way.

####Abstracting Cloud Computing

Heroku is a cloud-based, Platform as a Service (PaaS). Essentially it's a group of virtual machines that run on Amazon Web Services (EC2) and hosts your application code in the cloud. By using git, you can deploy your code directly to Heroku's machines - they call them "dynos" - and seconds later your changes will be live in production.

To deploy an app to Heroku, it's a fairly straightforward step-by-step process.

First you need to link your machine to your Heroku account - a similar process to what we did with Github.


## Before Deploying
1. Make sure you have an account with heroku: https://www.heroku.com/

2. Make sure you have installed the heroku toolbelt - [https://toolbelt.heroku.com/](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)

###Install Heroku Toolbelt

This is a command-line tool that allows us to use commands in the terminal, similar to the way that we use git.

Once it is installed, you need to login with your heroku credentials:

```
heroku login
Enter your Heroku credentials.
Email: adam@example.com
Password (typing will be hidden):
Authentication successful.
```

We'll have the ability to create free applications using Heroku, but with limitations. Most of those limitations are related to the size of the databases, as well as uptime for the dynos. For free applications, dynos will "go to sleep" when unused for a period of time. This will lead to slow start times when restarting the dynos.

##DEPLOY!

### To start:

* Create a `Procfile` in the root of your Node application
  * In terminal, run `touch Procfile`. Must be called with a capitol P
  * make sure it is named "Procfile" (no extention) 
  * make sure your Procfile is in the same folder as your index.js file) 
  * in terminal type `echo "web: node index.js" >> Procfile`

* In your `index.js` file, where you get your server started, include the port number in your app.listen function. Example:

```js
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000)
```

This ensures that when we set the PORT config variable, Heroku will run on it instead of the 3000 port (Heroku automatically includes a port that's public-facing).

* Your package.json file is **crucial** - when you deploy your application, Heroku will check the package.json file for all dependencies so whenever you install anything with npm make sure to use `--save`. You can always check your package.json to see if you are missing anything.

* Before you create your app in Heroku, be sure your project is being tracked via a git repository.

* Create a Heroku app via the command line

```
heroku apps:create sitename
```

Where `sitename` is the name of your app. This will create a url like: `http://sitename.herokuapp.com`

* Commit and push all your data at this point (`git push`).

* To push to Heroku, enter the following command

```
git push heroku master
```

* In terminal after you deploy your app, type in `heroku ps:scale web=1`
  * this will scale a dyno up

## Connect a DB with Sequelize

* In terminal, install the add-on for postgres: `heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev`
* Set your NODE_ENV variable to 'production' by running this command in terminal: `heroku config:set NODE_ENV='production'` 
* Make sure your production variables in `config/config.json` are set like this (pay attention to the production setting).

**config/config.json**
```js
{
  "development": {
    "database": "projectdb_development",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "postgres"
  },
  "test": {
    "database": "projectdb_test",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "postgres"
  },
  "production": {
    "use_env_variable": "DATABASE_URL",
    "dialect": "postgres"
  }
}

```

* To migrate our live database we need a local version of `sequelize-cli` module in our package json. Add it by running `npm install sequelize-cli --save`

* Add and commit your changes to git, then push your changes to heroku using `git push heroku master`

* Now run your migrations by typing in terminal `heroku run node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate` and you should have all your tables set up in a heroku hosted database

* Try opening your app now, `heroku open`

##Heroku Envionment variables

In your javascript code, you might have something like `process.env.GOOGLE_KEY`.
In order to add environment variables to github. We will run a heroku command to set it per item in our .env file

```
heroku config:set S3_KEY=8N029N81 S3_SECRET=9s83109d3+583493190
```

##Review
* App deployment
  * Login to Heroku using the Heroku toolbelt (only do once)
  * Create a Procfile and fetch your port in your app
  * Create a Heroku app

  * Install Heroku's postgres addon
  * Set the NODE_ENV variable on Heroku
  * Set the production database variables in `config/config.json`
  * Save a local version of `sequelize-cli` to the `package.json` file
  * Push application to Heroku
  * Run migrations on Heroku
